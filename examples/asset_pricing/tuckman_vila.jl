# # Tuckman–Vila (1992): a finite-horizon problem
#
# So far every model has been stationary. Tuckman–Vila is **time-dependent**: an arbitrageur
# faces holding costs over a finite horizon ``[0, T]``, so the value function ``F(z, \tau)``
# depends on calendar time. `pdesolve` handles this by taking a time grid `τs` as a fourth
# argument and solving **backward** from a terminal condition. The PDE function then takes a
# third argument `τ`:
#
# ```math
# \partial_\tau F + \max_i\Bigl\{ (\mu + \sigma^2 F_z)\, a i - \tfrac12 \sigma^2 (a i)^2 \Bigr\}
#   - \rho z F_z + \tfrac12 \sigma^2 (F_{zz} - F_z^2) = 0.
# ```

# ## The model
#
# The parameters live in a `struct`:

# ## The state space
#
# We build the grid, the initial guess, and the time grid first, because they fix the names used
# everywhere else. The grid is a `NamedTuple` whose key is the state variable (`z`); the guess is
# a `NamedTuple` whose key is the unknown function (`F`), which here doubles as the terminal
# condition at `τs[end]`. These names reappear inside the equation below — e.g. `Fz_up` is the
# forward finite difference of `F` in `z`. The grid spans the stationary range of ``z`` (a
# mean-reverting Gaussian). Because the problem is finite-horizon, we also build a time grid `τs`
# over ``[0, T]``, which `pdesolve` will march backward along.

# ## The equation
#
# We now write the function encoding the HJB equation. Following the package convention, it
# takes the current `state` (a grid point) and `u` (each unknown together with its
# finite-difference derivatives there) and returns the time derivative of each unknown. Because
# the problem is time-dependent, it also takes a third argument, the time `τ`.

# ## The solution
#
# For a time-dependent problem `result.zero[i]` is the solution at time `τs[i]` (so
# `result.zero[end]` is the terminal condition). Plotting a few time slices shows the value
# building up as the remaining horizon lengthens — from the flat terminal ``F = 0`` toward the
# long-horizon profile.

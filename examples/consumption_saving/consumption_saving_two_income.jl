# # Achdou–Han–Lasry–Lions–Moll: consumption–saving with two income states
#
# A household saves in a riskless asset ``a`` at rate ``r`` and earns a labor income that
# switches between a low value ``y_l`` and a high value ``y_h`` as a two-state Poisson process
# (intensities ``\lambda_{lh}``, ``\lambda_{hl}``). There is **one** continuous state (assets
# ``a``) but **two coupled value functions** ``v_l(a)`` and ``v_h(a)``, one per income state,
# linked by the income transitions:
#
# ```math
# \rho\, v_j(a) = \max_c \frac{c^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma} + v_j'(a)\,(y_j + r a - c) + \lambda_{jk}\,\bigl(v_k(a)-v_j(a)\bigr), \qquad j \ne k.
# ```
#
# A **borrowing constraint** ``a \ge \underline a`` is enforced by preventing the asset drift
# from turning negative at the lower bound.

# ## Defining the model
#
# The parameters live in a `struct`:

using EconPDEs, Plots

# ## Defining the grid
#
# We define the grid, a `NamedTuple` keyed by the single continuous state ``a``. The asset grid is
# finer near the borrowing limit, where consumption is most curved; the borrowing limit itself is
# nudged just inside the natural limit ``-y_l/r`` to keep consumption strictly positive there.

# ## Defining an initial guess
#
# We define the initial guess, a `NamedTuple` keyed by the two unknown value functions ``v_l`` and
# ``v_h`` — one autarky-style starting value per grid point. These names (and their finite
# differences, such as `vla_up`) are what reappear in the equation below.

    vh = (m.ρ ./ m.γ .+ (1 .- m.γ) .* m.r)^(-m.γ) .* (stategrid[:a] .+ m.yh ./ m.r) .^ (1 - m.γ) ./ (1 - m.γ),
)

# ## Defining the PDE
#
# We now write the function encoding the HJB equation. Following the package convention, it
# takes the current `state` (a grid point) and `u` (each unknown together with its
# finite-difference derivatives there) and returns the time derivative of each unknown.
#
# In each income state we upwind the asset drift on its sign, capping the implied consumption
# rather than flooring the marginal value (Newton may try negative marginal values). At the
# borrowing constraint the drift is set to zero. We save consumption `cl`, `ch` to plot.

# ## Solving the model

# With the grid, guess, and equation in hand, `pdesolve` solves the stationary system:

# ## The solution
#
# Consumption rises with wealth in both income states and is higher when income is high (left).
# The saving rate (right) is pinned at zero at the borrowing limit for the low-income household —
# which is forced to consume its income ``y_l + r a`` — and turns positive as wealth rises.

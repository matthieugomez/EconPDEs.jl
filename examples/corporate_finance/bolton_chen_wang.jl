# # Bolton–Chen–Wang (2009): investment with costly external finance
#
# Bolton, Chen, and Wang build a unified theory of investment, financing, and cash management. A
# firm faces **costly external finance**, so it hoards cash as a buffer against shocks. The single
# state is the cash–capital ratio ``w``, and the unknown is firm value per unit of capital
# ``v(w)`` — a generalized Tobin's ``q``. It solves the HJB equation
#
# ```math
# r\,v(w) = \max_{i}\;(i-\delta)\bigl(v - w\,v'\bigr) + \bigl((r-\lambda)w + A - i - \tfrac{\theta}{2}i^2\bigr)v' + \tfrac{\sigma^2}{2}v'',
# ```
#
# with optimal investment ``i = \tfrac{1}{\theta}\!\left(\tfrac{v}{v'} - w - 1\right)``. Two
# endogenous boundaries close the model: a *payout* boundary, where the marginal value of cash
# ``v'`` falls to one, and a *refinancing* boundary, where the firm issues equity at marginal cost
# ``\gamma`` and fixed cost ``\phi``.

# ## The model
#
# The parameters:

using EconPDEs, NLsolve, Plots

# ## The state space
#
# We build the grid and the initial guess first, because they fix the names used everywhere else.
# The grid is a `NamedTuple` whose key is the state variable (`w`, the cash–capital ratio); the
# guess is a `NamedTuple` whose key is the unknown function (`v`), holding one starting value at
# each grid point (firm value is initialized to the cash ratio ``w`` itself). These names are what
# reappear inside the equation below — e.g. `vw_up` will be the forward finite difference of `v`
# in `w`.

stategrid = (; w = range(0.0, 0.3, length = 100))
yend = (; v = stategrid[:w])

# ## The equation
#
# We now write the function encoding the HJB equation. Following the package convention, it takes
# the current `state` (a grid point) and `u` — the local bundle holding the unknown and its
# finite-difference derivatives there (`v`, `vw_up`, `vw_down`, `vww`) — and returns the time
# derivative `vt`.
#
# The cash drift ``\mu_w`` can point either way, so the marginal value of cash is upwinded:
# forward (`vw_up`) where the drift is positive, backward (`vw_down`) where it is negative.

# The guessed slopes are only a starting point. We then use `NLsolve` to find the boundary slopes
# that satisfy the value-matching and optimality conditions of Bolton–Chen–Wang (2009) — one at
# the refinancing boundary (marginal value of cash ``1+\gamma``) and one at the payout boundary
# (marginal value of cash ``1``) — and re-solve at the fixed point.

# ## The solution
#
# Firm value ``v(w)`` is increasing and concave in the cash–capital ratio: an extra dollar of
# internal cash is worth more than one (``v'(w)>1``) because external finance is costly, and this
# marginal value declines as the buffer grows. Investment ``i(w)`` rises with cash, so a cash-poor
# firm underinvests — internal liquidity, not just fundamentals, drives real investment. Both
# panels use the solution at the boundary slopes pinned down by `NLsolve`.

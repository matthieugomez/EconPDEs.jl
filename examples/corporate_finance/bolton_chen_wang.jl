# # Bolton–Chen–Wang (2009): investment with costly external finance
#
# Bolton, Chen, and Wang build a unified theory of investment, financing, and cash management. A
# firm faces **costly external finance**, so it hoards cash as a buffer against shocks. The single
# state is the cash–capital ratio ``w``, and the unknown is firm value per unit of capital
# ``v(w)`` — a generalized Tobin's ``q``. It solves the HJB equation
#
# ```math
# r\,v(w) = \max_{i}\;(i-\delta)\bigl(v - w\,v'\bigr) + \bigl((r-\lambda)w + A - i - \tfrac{\theta}{2}i^2\bigr)v' + \tfrac{\sigma^2}{2}v'',
# ```
#
# with optimal investment ``i = \tfrac{1}{\theta}\!\left(\tfrac{v}{v'} - w - 1\right)``. Two
# endogenous boundaries close the model: a *payout* boundary, where the marginal value of cash
# ``v'`` falls to one, and a *refinancing* boundary, where the firm issues equity at marginal cost
# ``\gamma`` and fixed cost ``\phi``.

# ## Defining the model
#
# The parameters:

using EconPDEs, NLsolve, Plots

# ## Defining the grid

# We define the grid, a `NamedTuple` keyed by the state ``w`` (the cash–capital ratio).

# ## Defining an initial guess
#
# We define the initial guess, a `NamedTuple` keyed by the unknown function ``v`` — one value per
# grid point, with firm value initialized to the cash ratio ``w`` itself. This name (and its finite
# differences, such as `vw_up`) is what reappears in the equation below.

guess = (; v = stategrid[:w])

# ## Defining the PDE
#
# We now write the function encoding the HJB equation. Following the package convention, it takes
# the current `state` (a grid point) and `u` — the local bundle holding the unknown and its
# finite-difference derivatives there (`v`, `vw_up`, `vw_down`, `vww`) — and returns the time
# derivative `vt`.
#
# The cash drift ``\mu_w`` can point either way, so the marginal value of cash is upwinded:
# forward (`vw_up`) where the drift is positive, backward (`vw_down`) where it is negative.

# ## Solving the model
#
# We first solve the HJB with guessed slopes for the marginal value of cash at the two boundaries.

result = pdesolve(m, stategrid, guess; bc = (; vw = (1.5, 1.0)))

# The guessed slopes are only a starting point. We then use `NLsolve` to find the boundary slopes
# that satisfy the value-matching and optimality conditions of Bolton–Chen–Wang (2009) — one at
# the refinancing boundary (marginal value of cash ``1+\gamma``) and one at the payout boundary
# (marginal value of cash ``1``) — and re-solve at the fixed point.

  i = 1 / m.θ * (v[wi] - w[wi] - 1)
  out[2] = m.r * v[wi] - (i - m.δ) * (v[wi] - w[wi]) - ((m.r - m.λ) * w[wi] + m.A - i - m.θ * i^2 / 2)

# ## The solution
#
# Firm value ``v(w)`` is increasing and concave in the cash–capital ratio: an extra dollar of
# internal cash is worth more than one (``v'(w)>1``) because external finance is costly, and this
# marginal value declines as the buffer grows. Investment ``i(w)`` rises with cash, so a cash-poor
# firm underinvests — internal liquidity, not just fundamentals, drives real investment. Both
# panels use the solution at the boundary slopes pinned down by `NLsolve`.
